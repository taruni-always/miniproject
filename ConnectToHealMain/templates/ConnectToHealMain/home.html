    <div style = "color: black;"></div>Mental health is the most neglected health problem worldwide. We hear many cases where people suffer from
                  depression and anxiety due to various reasons like work-related stress. Statistically speaking, approximately 280 million
                  people in the world have depression. Though many people stigmatize it, mental illness is a very serious problem that
                  needs to be addressed. If you suffer from a mental illness, the common conception is that thereâ€™s something wrong with
                  you, as a person, as a human being. This needs to stop. Although we see a drastic change in the number of people
                  considering mental health as a serious issue, we still have a long way to go. Untreated mental illnesses are also
                  becoming increasingly common across the globe.  You get to choose your preferred therapist and share anything you want with
                  them. Not comfortable sharing your personal information to a stranger on the internet? We got you! You can book the
                  sessions anonymously without revealing your identity. This is us, doing our part in reducing the devastating repercussions
                  of untreated mental illnesses, because as they say, "Change doesn't happen overnight" !</P>
